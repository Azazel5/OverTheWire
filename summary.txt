Level 1 --> Level 2 = The - character is special in linux because any files named that cannot be opened
normally using cat. You must redirect input to the file to get its contents out.

Level 2 --> Level 3 = Spaces in file names can be cat-ted by cat 'file name here'

Level 4 --> Level 5 = You can also do ./file_name if the file begins with a -, which
linux may confuse as a command line argument. Also, the file command is useful
in checking type, content, etc of a file.


Level 5 --> Level 6 = Listed all directories and files' size using the du command
specifying bytes and the -a argument. Then I piped the output to sort -h and sorted
the file size and catt-ed the right directory.

Level 6 --> Level 7 = Used the find command to list all files belonging to -group,
-user, and -size 133c (for bytes). Usually you get a bunch of permission denied
errors, which you can redirect to /dev/null for bs sdouts. 

Level 8 --> Level 9 = You were on the right path as to do uniq -u to spit out 
only unique lines, but remember to sort it first, otherwise it will not do proper
filtering.

Level 9 --> Level 10 = Use the strings command if you have a need of filtering
strings out of any data. I did that and piped the output to a grep which matched
'^=' i.e. any string beginning with = sign.

Level 11 --> Level 12 = Transforming text is done easily via the tr command which
takes two sets of texts and can take the union or deletion of several operations.
Using that, we can transform any alphabetical text [a-zA-Z] to [a-mn-zA-MN-Z] 
i.e. 13 units up for each character.

Level 12 --> Level 13 = There are several formats of zipping, unzipping, and
hexdumping files. For hexdumps, the xxl command is useful to reverse or create
them. For zip files, there are the tar, gzip, and bzip2 functionalities.

Level 13 --> Level 14 = ssh can be done via the use of public keys and private
keys. If you got a private key, you can specify it with the -i flag. Also, 
once you're logged into a system and want to bounce to another system, the host
will be localhost because localhost is the current system.

Level 14 --> Level 15 = Remember the difference between ssh and telent. One is 
for logging in and the other is for data transfer among other things.
